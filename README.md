Reach For The Stars, an interacrive visualization of our solar system!

# Summary
This is a small, interactive visualization of our solar system. Clicking on each planet will bring its respective information up in a small window at the bottom. The planets orbit the sun. Although distances from the sun are not accurate, the relative sizes, orbit speeds, etc are accurate (within reason due to device screen size constraints).

# Plans
I still need to add all planets and their respective information. I also need to clean my code up a bit and prettify the UI of the web app.
