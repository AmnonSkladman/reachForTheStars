# reachForTheStars
Reach For The Stars, an interactive visualization of our solar system!

# Summary
This is a small, interactive visualization of our solar system. Clicking on each planet will bring its respective information up in a small window at the bottom. The planets orbit the sun. Although distances from the sun are not accurate, the relative sizes, orbit speeds, etc are accurate (within reason due to device screen size constraints).

# DEPRECATED
Please go [here](https://github.com/AmnonSkladman/Star_System) for a remake of this project build in ReactJS.
