Reach For The Stars, an interacrive visualization of our solar system!

# Summary
This is a small, interactive visualization of our solar system.

# Plans
I am planning on adding all of the main planets and have them all orbit and rotate as accurately as possible. Due to device screen size contraints, distances will not be accurate. Sizes will be semi-accurate. I am also planning on making the planets clickable so as to display information about each planet, including orbital periods, temperatures, etc.
